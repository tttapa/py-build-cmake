# Example project using py-build-cmake and SWIG

This is an example package with a C++ extension module using
[SWIG](https://github.com/swig/swig). When building for CPython, the stable ABI
is used, which means that you don't need one wheel for each version of CPython.

For more information about the file structure and the configuration files,
please see the [`minimal` example](../minimal).
